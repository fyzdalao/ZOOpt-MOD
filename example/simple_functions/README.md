# Optimization Examples on Simple Functions

Several optimization examples are defined in `continuous_opt.py`, `discrete_opt.py`, `discrete_with_order_opt.py`, `mixed_opt.py`, `opt_under_noise.py` and `quick_start.py`.

Four kinds of simple functions are defined in `simple_function.py`

* `sphere`: a convex hyper-sphere function in real dimensions

* `ackley`: a non-convex ackley function with many local optima in real dimensions

* `setcover`: an instance of the NP-hard minimum set cover problem in discrete dimensions

* `mixed_function`: a sum-of-all-dimension function for mixed real/discrete dimensions
